A model only contians the business logic of the code.

By business logic i means like:
defining the schema of documents in the collection
defining all validations like required or not etc.
defining constraints etc.

It doesn't deal with the req-res part of the api.
That is for the controller.

Now we will no longer need fs module, bcz we can 
create new data and do operations on it ourselves.
That read/writing file part is over.
