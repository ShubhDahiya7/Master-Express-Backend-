Few steps about the Flow of what happens when a req is made to a endpt, how the specific router middleware works.

Route Setup: tourRouter is defined using express.Router(), and routes are assigned to it for handling requests to /api/v1/tours.

Steps: 

GET Request (/api/v1/tours):

Client sends a GET request to /api/v1/tours.
tourRouter.get('/') is triggered.
It responds with a 200 status and a list of tours.

POST Request (/api/v1/tours):

Client sends a POST request with tour data to /api/v1/tours.
tourRouter.post('/') is triggered.
The new tour is added to the array, and the data is saved to tours-simple.json.
It responds with a 201 status and the newly created tour.

Export Router: tourRouter is exported to be used in the main Express app for routing.

Integration in Main App: The tourRouter is mounted at /api/v1/tours using app.use('/api/v1/tours', tourRouter).
